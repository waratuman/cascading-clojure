;;BEWARE of the iterator-tap and the mutable-reused tuple iterator entries!!!!!

;; <stuartsierra> bradford: careful you don't hang on to the Writable objects from the iterator -- Hadoop reuses them
;; <bradford> yea, that may have had something to do with the interaction with interator-seq <stuartsierra> I ran into this ages ago, which is why iterator-seq was created in the first place.
;; <cwensel> fyi, cascading 1.1 also reuses non primitive types inside tuples as well
