Most applications will need to call setApplicationJarClass(java.util.Map, Class) or setApplicationJarPath(java.util.Map, String)  so that the correct application jar file is passed through to all child processes. The Class or path must reference the custom application jar, not a Cascading library class or jar. The easiest thing to do is give setApplicationJarClass the Class with your static main function and let Cascading figure out which jar to use."
